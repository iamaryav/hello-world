what is functional interface
 

 

Java 8 feature

Lambada expression

Functional interface

Default method

Static method

Stream API

Method references

Optional Class

Memory related changes Introduce Metaspace

HashMap in linked list is converted BST.

 

 

Design pattern

Solid principle

Singleton class

 

Map and flatmap

Filter

Reduce

 

Available Functional interface

Predicate

Function

Supplier

consumer

 

Program for Stream API

Class Employee {

String name;

List<String> phoneNumber;

String deptName;

Double salaray;

}

 

Find 2 highest salary from employee class

Group on department and give the count  

List on all Phone numbers

Filter employee name with start with name "Vi"

 

String s = "Hello I am java";

Find the occurrence in using stream API

Reverse the string using stream API

 

Addition of array elements using stream api

 

Addition pair for integer list as provided number

{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0} -> 6 and pair for it{ {1,5},{2,4},{0,6}}

 

What is final and static

Create a Immutable class

HashCode  & Equal method and contract

Volatile keyword

Serialization & De Serialization

Linkedlist / arraylist/Map /set

ConcurrentModification Execption and overcome on it

ConcurrnetHashMap / CopyOnWriteArrayList

Comparable / Comparator

 

Thread / Multithread/

Synchronized block/ Synchronized block

Executor framework

Compatible future and why they came.

Sleep and wait method

 

Spring bean creation / life Cycle bean

List out Annotation

Scope of beans

Controller vs. Rest Controller

Spring vs. spring boot

@SpringBootApplication means  

@autoconfiguration and give some default auto configuration in spring boot.

GetMapping vrs RequestMapping
