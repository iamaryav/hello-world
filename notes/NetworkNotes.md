### Backend communication design patterns
    - Request Response
    - Synchronous and Asynchronous (worklaods)
    - Push
    - Short Polling
    - Long Polling
    - Server sent events
    - Publisher / Subscriber
    - Multiplexing and Demultiplexing (combining connections)
    - Statefull vs stateless
    - Sidecar pattern
### Protocols
    - OSI Model
    - TCP / IP Protocol
    - UDP
    - TCP

### OSI Models
    - why? - How you are going to talk diff computer over network
    - 7 layers
### TCP/IP Models
### Projects
    - Useful tools curl, netcat
    - Build UDP - server and clinet in python and c
    - Build TCP - server and client in python and c
### Protocols
    - webRTC for Peer to peer connection

### Backend execution Design patterns
