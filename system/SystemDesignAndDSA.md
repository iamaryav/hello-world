# System Desgin designing steps
## Requirements, Initial design, Final design, Evaluation
1. Requirement and the goals of the system (Functional and Non functional)
2. Capacity estimation and constraints
    - Read and write (Traffic) estimation (Read-Write ratio estimation)
    - Storage estimation
    -  Bandwidth estimation
    - Memory estimation
    - Most estimation in /sec
3. High Level design
4. Database Schema and API Design
5. Detailed component design
6. Evaluation


# DSA steps:
1. Requirement analysis 
2. write algo or pseudo code
3. Improve your algo for time and space complexity with the help of data structures
4. start programming
5. Test your programm
```
Listen Carefully

Example - Debug your example (Find edge case if any)

Brute force solution - get something working

Optimize - BUD(Bottlenecks, Unnecessary Work, Duplicated work) Optimization 

Walk Through - Walk through your approach in detail

Implement - Write beautiful code - Keep talking

Test - test your code
