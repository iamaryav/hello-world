# System Desgin designing steps
## Requirements, Initial design, Final design, Evaluation
Functional and Non Functional requirement
1. Requirement and the goals of the system (Functional and Non functional)
2. Capacity estimation and constraints (Back of the envelop calculation rough calculation)
    - Read and write (Traffic) estimation (Read-Write ratio estimation)
    - Storage estimation
    -  Bandwidth estimation
    - Memory estimation
    - Most estimation in /sec
3. High Level design
4. Database Schema and API Design
5. Detailed component design
6. Evaluation


# DSA steps:
1. Requirement analysis 
2. write algo or pseudo code
3. Improve your algo for time and space complexity with the help of data structures
4. start programming
5. Test your programm
```
Listen Carefully

Example - Debug your example (Find edge case if any)

Brute force solution - get something working

Optimize - BUD(Bottlenecks, Unnecessary Work, Duplicated work) Optimization 

Walk Through - Walk through your approach in detail

Implement - Write beautiful code - Keep talking

Test - test your code


```

## System Design
1. Scoping out the problem with Interviewer means what to design or what functionality to design
2.
